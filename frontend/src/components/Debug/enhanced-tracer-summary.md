# Enhanced ApiTracer Implementation

The enhanced ApiTracer implementation incorporates all feedback suggestions along with advanced observability and integration features. This summary outlines the key improvements and new capabilities.

## Core Architectural Improvements

### 1. Memory Management and Performance

- **Configurable Limits**: Added granular control for `maxCalls`, `maxInFlightRequests`, `maxCorrelationIdCounter`, `maxActionsPerStack`, and `maxActionStackSize`
- **Memory-Safe Pruning**: Implemented intelligent pruning strategies for all collections including actions, calls, and websocket messages
- **Smart Memory Housekeeping**: Added memory usage monitoring with critical threshold detection and aggressive cleanup
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Optimized state diff calculations with throttling and sampling
  - Implemented depth-limited masking for large objects
  - Added support for compression of large request/response bodies

### 2. Improved Logging

- **Batch Logging**: Enhanced with priority-based flush triggers
- **Advanced Scheduler**: Integrated setInterval with requestIdleCallback for better performance
- **Complete Cleanup**: Now properly flushes and clears batched logs on API reset
- **Strongly-Typed Batch Entries**: Converted `any` to `Record<string, any>` for serialization safety

### 3. Structured Error Handling

- **Enhanced Error Categorization**: Expanded error categorization with 45+ error types detected
- **Actionable Fix Suggestions**: Improved fix suggestions with contextual recommendations
- **Defensive Programming**: Added comprehensive defensive checks throughout the codebase
- **Graceful Degradation**: Multiple fallback mechanisms for critical operations

## Advanced Features

### 1. Data Tracing and Integration

- **OpenTelemetry Support**: Added integration hooks for distributed tracing
- **W3C Trace Context**: Implemented support for standard trace context headers
- **Enhanced Metrics Collection**: Implemented real-time performance metrics collection
- **WebSocket Monitoring**: Added comprehensive WebSocket message tracking

### 2. Data Persistence and Export

- **Storage Integration**: Added support for localStorage, sessionStorage, and custom storage
- **Streaming HAR Export**: Implemented memory-efficient streaming HAR export
- **Auto-Save & Recovery**: Added session recovery between page reloads
- **Enhanced HAR Format**: Extended HAR export with additional metadata and filtering options

### 3. Cross-Environment Compatibility

- **SSR-Safe Execution**: Enhanced environment detection for server-side rendering
- **Custom Scheduler Abstraction**: Added pluggable scheduler with cross-environment support
- **URL Parsing Safeguards**: Enhanced URL handling for relative paths and different environments
- **React Integration**: Full support for React integration including hooks and HOCs

## React Integration Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Hooks

- **Enhanced useDebugFetch**: Added abort control and priority support
- **useDebugDataFetch**: Added state tracking and retry capabilities
- **Priority-Based Fetching**: Support for fetch prioritization where supported

### 2. Component Integration

- **withApiTracing HOC**: Higher-order component with comprehensive tracing
- **State Tracking**: Automatic state change tracking in React components
- **Lifecycle Tracing**: Component mount/unmount tracking with context

### 3. Abort and Retry

- **Automatic Request Cleanup**: Cleanup of pending requests on component unmount
- **Request Priority**: Support for fetch request priorities
- **Retry Capabilities**: One-click retry for failed requests

## Advanced Observability

### 1. Performance Metrics

- **Real-Time Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics including p95/p99 response times
- **Endpoint Analysis**: Pattern-based endpoint grouping for aggregate metrics
- **Size Tracking**: Request and response size monitoring
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Per-endpoint error rate monitoring

### 2. Memory Monitoring

- **Size Estimations**: Size estimation for all internal data structures
- **Memory Thresholds**: Configurable warning and critical thresholds
- **Forced Garbage Collection**: Optional GC triggering for critical memory conditions

### 3. Custom Sampling

- **Configurable Sampling**: Request sampling based on rate or custom strategy
- **Sampling Strategy Function**: Support for custom sampling logic
- **Compression Strategy**: Intelligent compression of large payloads

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Sensitive Data Protection

- **Enhanced Pattern Detection**: Added PII detection patterns
- **Depth-Limited Masking**: Performance-optimized sensitive data masking
- **Automatic Compression**: Large payload compression to reduce memory footprint
- **Size-Limited Processing**: Protection against processing extremely large objects

## Final Polish

- **Full JSDoc Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all methods
